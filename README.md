### FAQs

#### Who are you? Why are you doing this?
We are an informal collective of online activists who want to preserve and enhance the open internet. We are not taking any financial compensation for this. This is a free, public, (and hopefully delightful!) open-source effort.

#### How can I help?

1) Please spread the word on your socials that this project exists, and please encourage your friends and colleagues to add their info in the form here: https://forms.gle/by6GPy99oRZNXcC36
2) If you're a developer, we would love your help in coming up with a nice search and browsing UI for this directory.
3) Open to any other ideas!

### What's the licensing for the directory?

This directory is MIT licensed. Here's what that means, from Wikipedia: "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1980s. As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility."
