# Public Handles Directory
A delightful, public, open-source social media directory
---
Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - we created a free, public, open-source social media directory. We hope it will help folks to stay in touch freely across the Internet. And that it will help developers to build new, open, social applications.

The directory is open-source and lives here: https://github.com/publicreader/publicdirectory/blob/main/directory.csv.

Here are the details behind it:

### FAQs

#### Who are you? Why are you doing this?
We are an informal collective of online activists who want to preserve and enhance the open internet. We are not taking any financial compensation for this. This is a free, public, (and hopefully delightful!) open-source effort.

#### How can I help?

1) Please spread the word on your socials that this project exists, and please encourage your friends and colleagues to add their info in the form here: https://forms.gle/by6GPy99oRZNXcC36
2) If you're a developer, we would love your help in coming up with a nice search and browsing UI for this directory.
3) Open to any other ideas!

### What's the licensing for the directory?

This directory is MIT licensed. Here's what that means, from Wikipedia: "The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1980s. As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility."

### How often will the directory get updated?

We will look to update it once a day with new submissions. 

### What is your policy on abuse, harrassement, and free speech?

This is a really important question. To minimize potential abuse and harassment of folks, we will not list accounts that are known to have been banned or suspended on Twitter prior to November 1, 2022

### How will you deal with duplicate records?

We use Twitter handles as the key to merge duplicate records.

### Any other questions?
